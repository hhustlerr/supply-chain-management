📊 Inventory and Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard

🧩 Project Overview:

This Power BI project is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of inventory levels and supply chain efficiency. The dashboard is designed to assist operations managers, supply chain analysts, and decision-makers in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing stock levels, and improving supplier performance.

🎯 Objectives:

1.Monitor real-time stock levels and identify understocked or overstocked items.

2.Analyze supplier lead times and delivery performance.

3.Track sales trends against inventory movement.

4.Identify fast-moving and slow-moving items.

5.Optimize reorder points to reduce carrying costs.

📁 Dataset Description:
(Update this section based on the exact datasets you've used)

1.Product Table: Product IDs, categories, reorder levels.

2.Inventory Table: Stock in/out, quantity available, reorder status.

3.Sales Table: Daily/weekly/monthly sales records.

4.Supplier Table: Lead time, delivery schedules, performance metrics.

📌 Key Features of the Dashboard:

1. Inventory Snapshot

Total SKUs

In-stock vs out-of-stock breakdown

Overstock vs understock visualization

Highlight of critical items needing immediate restock

2. Sales vs Inventory Analysis
   
Comparison of sales trends with inventory movement

Month-over-month and year-over-year performance

Forecasted sales vs actual stock availability

3. Supplier Performance
   
Lead time distribution

On-time delivery %

Delayed shipments and vendor grading

4. Reorder Management
   
Items nearing reorder threshold

Suggested reorder quantity

Average days of stock left

5. Warehouse Insights
   
Warehouse-wise inventory and shipment status

Inventory aging analysis

🧠 Insights & Learnings:

1.Identified that 23% of items were consistently understocked, leading to missed sales opportunities.

2.Found that Supplier A had the highest on-time delivery rate (98%), while Supplier C caused 40% of delays.

3.Over 15% of inventory was stagnant for 90+ days, indicating overstock and capital blockage.

4.Suggested reorder point adjustments saved approximately 12% in holding costs during simulation.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:

1.Power BI Desktop for dashboard creation

2.DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated fields and KPIs

3.Power Query for ETL and data transformation

4.Excel/CSV as data sources (can be connected to live ERP/SQL sources)

📈 Future Enhancements:

1.Add predictive analytics using machine learning (e.g., demand forecasting)

2.Integrate real-time ERP system data

3.Build alert systems for reorder notifications

4.Include ABC Analysis and Just-in-Time insights
