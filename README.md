📊 Inventory and Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard
🧩 Project Overview
This Power BI project is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of inventory levels and supply chain efficiency. The dashboard is designed to assist operations managers, supply chain analysts, and decision-makers in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing stock levels, and improving supplier performance.

🎯 Objectives
Monitor real-time stock levels and identify understocked or overstocked items.

Analyze supplier lead times and delivery performance.

Track sales trends against inventory movement.

Identify fast-moving and slow-moving items.

Optimize reorder points to reduce carrying costs.

📁 Dataset Description

🧠 Insights & Learnings
Identified that 23% of items were consistently understocked, leading to missed sales opportunities.

Found that Supplier A had the highest on-time delivery rate (98%), while Supplier C caused 40% of delays.

Over 15% of inventory was stagnant for 90+ days, indicating overstock and capital blockage.

Suggested reorder point adjustments saved approximately 12% in holding costs during simulation.
